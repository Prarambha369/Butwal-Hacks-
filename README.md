**Empowering Builders, Creators, and Innovators in Western Nepal**

## About Us

Butwal Hacks is a student-led community where curiosity meets creativity. We create spaces for young minds to experiment, collaborate, and transform ideas into reality across Rupandehi District, Nepal.

In Rupandehi District, access to tech events and creative communities is still developing. Many students have talent and passion but lack opportunities to practice skills in coding, design, engineering, robotics, and digital creativity. Butwal Hacks fills that gap with a platform that is open, inclusive, supportive, and driven by students who understand other students.

## 🌟 Our Mission

We exist to support young people through learning, growth, and accessibility-focused events and programs.

### What We Stand For

- **Curiosity** - Fostering the desire to explore, learn, and ask questions about technology
- **Creativity** - Empowering students to turn ideas into real projects and solutions
- **Collaboration** - Building a supportive community where knowledge is shared freely
- **Community** - Creating lasting spaces for growth beyond the classroom

### Deploying to Vercel

The Next.js application is located in the `my-app` directory. The repository includes a `vercel.json` configuration file at the root that tells Vercel how to build and deploy the app from the subdirectory.

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Vercel will automatically use the `vercel.json` configuration to build from the `my-app` directory
4. Click "Deploy" and your site will be live!

Alternatively, you can deploy directly using the Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```
